How the program runs flowchart wise + things u need to do in chronological order
 (still read through the requirements, i may have missed stuff)
    -make a structure
    -make a loop to read through a file 
    -close input file
    -fill out an array of structures
    -do the calculations
    -write to an output file
    -close to output file
Make sure you use functions for this
there is no extra credit, so just use scanf for command line arguements (i think)
    -look at the demonstration program he mentions in the pdf, because it may want it done a specific way

-make sure you do all the requirements in the pdf, this isnt everything this is kind of just the skeleton for the project, something for reference.
